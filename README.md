I made these two project to pratice my programing logics and study lists and loops in phyton. each projects have two versions, one is the first normal version when I didnâ€™t know what I was doing and the plus, he is the last version what i made the system.
It is a simple system where you tell the program what you want (add or remove the number) the first version is very broken, so when I studied, I decided to create a new project with the same idea, so I made 'estudo02Plus'. The system is in my language (Portuguese).
